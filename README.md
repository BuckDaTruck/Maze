## Introduction
This project provides a maze running and solution algorithm. It is designed to find the shortest path through a maze using various algorithms.

## Features
- Maze generation
- Maze solving using different algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Visualization of the maze and the solution path

## Installation
To install the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuckDaTruck/Maze.git
cd maze-solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the maze solver, use the following command:
```bash
python solve.py
```
You can customize the maze size and the algorithm used by modifying the configuration file.
